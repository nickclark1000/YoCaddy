YoCaddy Mobile is a stand alone golf tracking application for personal use.  Yo Caddy can be used entirely on
it's own to update:
- Walking Paths
- Club Selections
- Round Scores
- Basic Round Statistics
- Sharing Round information with friends via Facebook, Foursquare, etc.

or can be used in combination with YoCaddy Web (http://www.yocaddy.com) to track more detailed round statistics, as 
well as creating a comprehensive tournament score/reference book.  Integration with YoCaddy Web requires a user 
account to be created.
